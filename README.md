#  Side-Walk Autonomous Delivery Robot•	Designed and implemented power distribution circuits for supplying subsystems.
•	Collaborated with the team to integrate sensors and controllers into the automation framework.
•	Developed a Battery Management System (BMS) including:
	Voltage monitoring via voltage divider + ADC.
	MOSFET-based charge/discharge control.
	Cell balancing algorithm to equalize voltages.
•	Developed the embedded hardware for GPS integration to support autonomous navigation. 
•	Focused on embedded hardware and firmware for safe Li-ion battery operation.
